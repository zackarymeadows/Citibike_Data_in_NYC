## Summary:
According to the data provided by Citibike for NYC, an overwhelming majority of the customers are Male. 
Perhaps we could market towards the other half of the population to get even more riders!

We can also surmise that most of the bike usage is before and after normal work hours, (9am-5pm). 
One suggestion might be to lower prices, or increase reward program benefits in the late evening and early afternoon. 

More information can and should be gathered before going forward. It would be beneficial to study the population density and the demographic of customers around the most popular "pick-up" stops. This way we could tailor our marketing to similar areas in Des Moines.
